#Data Science Tools and Ecosystem
*
```
```
/*
In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized.
*/
```
```
/*
Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:

Python
R
SQL
Julia
Scala
*/
```
```
/*
##Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
NumPy - For numerical operations and array handling.
Pandas - For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib - For data visualization.
Scikit-learn - For machine learning algorithms.
TensorFlow - For deep learning and neural networks.

| Data Science Tools |
|--------------------|
| Jupyter Notebook   |
| RStudio            |
| Apache Zeppelin    |
*/
```
```
/*
**Objectives:**

List popular languages for Data Science.
Identify commonly used libraries in Data Science.
Recognize development environment tools for Data Science.
Evaluate basic arithmetic expressions in Python.
Convert units (e.g., minutes to hours) using Python.
*/
```
```
/*
###Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python.
result = (3 * 4) + 5
result
17
*/
```
```
/*
#This will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.
minutes = 200
hours = minutes / 60
